## The Mission

The design department of your company sent you a new section that needs to be added to their corporate website. It is intended to show the benefits of using their services in an easy to understand way.
Choose a framework, and recreate the layout below.
On desktop, the layout should look like below. If possible, on tablets each row should contain 2 cards. On mobile all cards should be in one column.

Make sure that on tablet and on mobile the layout still works (for example, columns stack on top of each other, etc).

- A wireframe is a schematic representation of the layout and structure of the page. It usually looks all grey. It is used to get approval on the structure, before proceeding with the real design.

## Instructions

- Choose a framework. If you don't have a lot of experience, start with a component-first framework such as Bootstrap or Bulma. If you want to dare you can start with a utility-     first framework such as Tailwind, but beware that it might require extra time to set up.

- You can find similar icons for free at https://www.flaticon.com/home (it's ok if they are not exactly the same: the layout, positioning and dimensions is what counts!)

- Find a similar font on https://fonts.google.com/ (it's ok if it's not exactly the same, but try to respect font size, color, etc.)

- First, try to get as close as possible without writing any CSS. Start from the general structure (a responsive grid with rectangular "cards" inside), then proceed with the inner   structure of each card.

- Once there isn't anything more you can "extract" from the framework of your choice, you can start adding custom CSS

- Deploy on the system of your choice (GitHub Pages or Netlify)
